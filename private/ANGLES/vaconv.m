function [zang]=vaconv( sva, salt, alt );

% function [zang]=vaconv( sva, salt, alt );
%
% Convert the satellite viewing angle (scanang)
% into the local path zenith angle (at ground, this is satzen)
%
% Input:
%    sva  : (1 x nobs) satellite/observing viewing angle (degrees)
%    salt : (1 x nobs) satellite/observing altitude (meters)
%    alt  : (nlevs x nobs) local path altitude (meters)
%
% Output:
%    zang : (nlevs x nobs) zenith angle (degrees)

% Created by Scott Hannon, 6 June 2002; based on our FORTRAN "vaconv.f"
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%    The layers of the atmosphere may be considered as concentric
%    rings with some average altitude. A ray traced thru these rings
%    at any viewing angle other than nadir will have a slightly
%    different angle (relative to the outward radial at the point
%    of intersection) in each ring. 
%
%    If the Earth is treated as a perfect sphere of radius RE (hard
%    coded into this routine), then the local angle may be calculated
%    using trigonometry if we know:
%       The satellite viewing angle
%       The satellite's altitude above the Earth's surface
%       The layer's altitude above the Earth's surface.
%
%    The solution uses the law of sines and sin(180 - x) = sin(x)
