% INPUTS (with examples)
%
% iAirs drives klayers, and eventually the convolver
%   iAirs = 0,-1,+1,2,3  : raw, AIRS, IASI, CRiS
%   example : iAirs = +1;     %%% doing things for AIRS
%
% iHITRAN sets the kCompressed directory, based on HITRAN
%   iHITRAN = 2000,2004,2008,2012 are your options
%
% iMatlab_vs_f77 tells the code whether the database is Matlab or ieee-le 
%   iMatlab_vs_f77 = +1   use Matlab version
%   iMatlab_vs_f77 = -1   use f77 version
%
% fA and fB are start and stop wavenumbers
%   example : fA = 605;  fB = 830; 
%
% iDoJac tells controls the jacobians gasids (-1 for none)
%   iDoJac = -1;                      %% no jacs
%   iDoJac = [iGid1 iGid2 ... iGidN]; %% do jacobians; the iGid tells which
%                                     %% gases to do amt jacs for 
%                                     %% (temp jacs always done)
%   warning : iGid1 = WV includes lines and continuum
%   example : iDoJac = [1 3];
%
% iJacobOutput controls the output jacobians units
%   iJacobOutput = -1;        %% dr/dT, dr/dq
%   iJacobOutput =  0;        %% dr/dT, dr/dq*q
%   iJacobOutput = +1;        %% dBT/dT, dBT/dq*q
%
% CKD is the CKD version : choose 1,2,3,4,5
%   example : CKD = '1';
%
% these next two define where the input rtp file is in
%   dir is the directory where the file is in
%   fin is the actual file
%   example : dirin = '/yourdir/'; 
%             fin = 'pin_feb2002_sea_airsnadir_op.sun.rtp';
%
% iProfRun is which of the rtp profiles to run
%   example iProfRun = 1;
%
% iNLTE is which NLTE model to run
%   example iNLTE = -1; % SARTA
%   example iNLTE = -2; % kCARTA Compressed
%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% OUTPUTS (with examples)
%
% structures "radsOut" and "jacsOut" are your output variables
%            "ropt0"   and "stuff"   give some useful input info
%
% example if fA,fB = 605,805; each 10000 point kCARTA chunk is 25 cm-1 wide, 
% so there are 9 chunks or 90000 wavenumber points in this run
%
%%%%%% 
%
% radsOut : always produced
%    freqAllChunks                  1x90000          freq      cm-1
%     radAllChunks                  90000x1          radiances mW/cm2/sr/cm-1
% iaa_kcomprstats_AllChunks          2x73            Singular Vectors stats
%
% ropt0 : reproduces important input parameters (from set_dirs) eg
%             kpath : '/yourdi/H2004_matlab'
%            soldir : '/yourdir/solarV2'

%            rsolar : 1
%            rtherm : 2
%              NLTE : -1 (use SARTA model)

% if iDoJac(1) > 0 then jacobians are computed. The output format of the
% jacobians depends on "iJacobOutput"
%    ejacAllChunks: [90000x1]       surface emissivity jacobians
